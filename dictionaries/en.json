When you link a wallet containing ADA to GovTool, GovTool will read the ADA balance in the wallet, and make it available to you to use as Voting Power. Voting Power can be used in several ways: Delegate your Voting Power to a DRep, How to delegate your Voting Power.",
    "question12": "What is Voting Power?",
    "answer12": "For ada holders voting power refers to the amount of ada they own. For registered DReps Voting Power refers to both to the voting power they own and to the voting power that other ada holders have delegated to them.",
    "question13": "What is a Governance Action?",
    "answer131": "A governance action is a proposal that is submitted on-chain for voting. It is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction and typically comes with an expiration period, after which the action cannot be enacted. Any ADA holder can submit a governance action, and once it's recorded on the ledger, voting transactions can be submitted to approve or ratify the action.",

In contrast, a governance action is a proposal that has been submitted on-chain for voting, making it an official on-chain event that includes features such as an expiration period, after which it can no longer be enacted.",
    "category4": "Voting",
    "question41": "What is On-Chain Voting?",
    "answer41": "On-Chain Voting is the process that allows the 3 voting bodies (DReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee) to submit their decision about On-Chain active Governance Actions, and so allows the Cardano Community and its ADA Holders to be represented in the Governance of Cardano.",
    "answer42": "In order for a Governance Action to get ratified through On-Chain voting it needs to meet voting thresholds from some or all of the voting bodies (depending on the Governance Action Type)."
