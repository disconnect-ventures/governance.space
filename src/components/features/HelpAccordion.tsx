                  A governance action is a proposal that is submitted on-chain
                  for voting. It is an on-chain event triggered by a transaction
                  and typically comes with an expiration period, after which the
                  action cannot be enacted. Any ADA holder can submit a
                  governance action, and once it&lsquo;s recorded on the ledger,
                  voting transactions can be submitted to approve or ratify the
                  action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, once a governance action is ratified after
                  reaching defined thresholds, it is enacted on-chain according
                  to a set of rules.

                A governance proposal is essentially a draft governance
                actionâ€”it represents a proposal that has not yet been submitted
                on-chain. In contrast, a governance action is a proposal that
                has been submitted on-chain for voting, making it an official
                on-chain event that includes features such as an expiration
                period, after which it can no longer be enacted.

                  On-Chain Voting is the process that allows the 3 voting bodies
                  (DReps, SPOs, Constitutional Committee) to submit their
                  decision about On-Chain active Governance Actions, and so
                  allows the Cardano Community and its ADA Holders to be
                  represented in the Governance of Cardano.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order for a Governance Action to get ratified through
                  On-Chain voting it needs to meet voting thresholds from some
                  or all of the voting bodies (depending on the Governance
                  Action Type).
